# Regression on tabular data
## Data analysis and building regression model that predicts an output based on the anonymised features
```
Python version: 3.9.12
```

Prediction based on `internship_hidden_test.csv` and `internship_train.csv` files

#### Steps in the project:
- Data analysis
- Choosing features for the model
- Training the model
- Predicting output for the test data

#### Files:
- `README.md`
- `requirements.txt`
- `analysis.jpynb` – Jupyter Notebook with data analysis
- `choosing_features.py` – program helping to determine features for regression
- `training_model.py` – training model and predicting test data

- `prediction.csv` – predicted values based on training model 


### In order the get predictions in CSV format:

1. Have internship_hidden_test.csv, internship_train.csv, in the same folder as other files
3. Run training_model.py
